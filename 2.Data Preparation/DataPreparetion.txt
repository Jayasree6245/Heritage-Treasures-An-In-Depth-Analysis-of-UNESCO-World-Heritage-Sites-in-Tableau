Preparing the data for visualization involves cleaning the data to remove irrelevant or missing data, transforming the data into a format 
that can be easily visualized, exploring the data to identify patterns and trends, filtering the data to focus on specific subsets of 
data, preparing the data for visualization software, and ensuring the data is accurate and complete. This process helps to make the data 
easily understandable and ready for creating visualizations to gain insights into the performance and efficiency. Since the data is already 
cleaned, we can move to visualization.
