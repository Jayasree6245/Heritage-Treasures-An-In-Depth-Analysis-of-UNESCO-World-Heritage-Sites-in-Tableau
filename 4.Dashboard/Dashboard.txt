A dashboard is a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays information and data in an organized, easy-to-read format. Dashboards are often 
used to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of data and are typically designed for a specific purpose or use case. Dashboards can be 
used in a variety of settings, such as business, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and many other industries. They can be used to track key 
performance indicators (KPIs), monitor performance metrics, and display data in the form of charts, graphs, and tables.
